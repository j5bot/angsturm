angsturm.js
============

angsturm.js is a layer of angular extensions (services, directives, etc.) which creates a layer between the server-side (resource) model and the final front-end markup generated.

Simply put, every piece of code and markup in between you and your data should be replacable depending on configurations, conventions, and runtime logic.  The building blocks you write should make sense without previous knowledge of the framework itself, i.e. they should be POLOs (plain old literal objects) and markup templates.

angsturm.js is being developed by Jonathan 'J5' Cook, generously open sourced (he hopes) by ViiMed / ViiNetworks.
