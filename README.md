angsturm.js
============

angsturm.js is a toolkit (or "framework" if you like) extending AngularJS by introducing composite multi-aspect components.  Composition occurs along lines including heirarchy, layout, component definition, component configuration, component behavior, and contract/data consumption.

As a fledgling toolkit, it is presented in the form of an example application, the [Interface Designer](http://www.angsturm.org/demo.html).  To get to know how the toolkit works, you will need to examine the example application code's configurations and data along with the angsturm.js code itself.
