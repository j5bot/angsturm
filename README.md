angsturm.js
============

angsturm.js is a toolkit (or "framework" if you like) extending AngularJS by introducing composite multi-aspect components.  Composition occurs along lines including heirarchy, layout, component definition, component configuration, component behavior, and contract/data consumption.

As a fledgling toolkit, it is presented in the form of an example application, the [Interface Designer](http://www.angsturm.org/demo.html).  To get to know how the toolkit works, you will need to examine the example application code's configurations and data along with the angsturm.js code itself.

Minimal documentation is also available in the wiki: [Documentation](https://github.com/j5bot/angsturm/wiki/%E2%84%ABngsturmJS-Config-Docs)
